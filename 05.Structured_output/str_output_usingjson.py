Despite its compact size, the sound quality is incredibly rich with surprisingly deep bass and crisp treble. The build feels premium, and its minimal, modern design fits perfectly on my work desk.
 Battery life is impressive tooâ€”I got nearly 10 hours of playback on a single charge. It paired seamlessly with my phone, and the connection remained stable throughout. For the price, this speaker is an absolute steal. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for powerful, portable audio on a budget.
