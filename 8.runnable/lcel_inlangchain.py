"""LangChain Expression Language"""

"""LCEL is a standard way inside LangChain to build, combine, and run chains without writing a lot of manual Python code.
It uses simple | (pipe) operators and composable runnables.

Think of LCEL like:

A visual pipeline of operations,

where data flows step-by-step from left to right,

without needing to subclass or manually define chains."""
