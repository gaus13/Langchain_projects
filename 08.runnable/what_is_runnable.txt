🛠️ In LangChain, Runnables are used for:
Sending a prompt to a model (like Groq, OpenAI, etc.)
Getting a response back.
Combining many small tasks together into a bigger task (like building Lego).



✨ Why are Runnables useful?
You can easily connect many parts together.
You can reuse them again and again.
You can build bigger things (like chains, workflows) from small Runnables.

ex:
runnable = llm.with_prompt(prompt_template)
response = runnable.invoke({"input": "Tell me a joke"})

These runnable are of two types:
1) Task specific runnable-
2) Runnable primitives-
