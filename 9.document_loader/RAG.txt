What are the imp components used to build RAG based app?
~ document loader
~ text splitter
~ vector Db
~ retrievers

Langchain mein bohot se doc-loader hai
4 most imp are: text loader, pyPDFloader, webbaseLoader, csvLoader
~in doc loader the text is always stored as py list.

~pyPDFloader is a doc loader in Langchain used to load content from pdf files and 
convert each page into a document object.(not great with scanned pdfs)

~ In LangChain, the DirectoryLoader (often used with a specific file loader like TextLoader, PyPDFLoader, etc.) is a utility that allows you to load multiple files from a directory at once,
 rather than loading each file individually.

~ also what is the diff btw load and lazy_load in LangChain
#load() — Eager Loading
Loads all documents immediately into memory.
Returns a list of Document objects.
Ideal when you expect a small to medium number of files or need all data upfront.

#lazy_load() — Lazy Loading (Generator)
Returns a generator instead of a list.
Documents are loaded one by one as you iterate over the result.
Memory-efficient and better for large datasets (e.g., 1000s of files or huge PDFs)

~what is webbaseLoader in Langchain
A web-based loader in LangChain is used to load data from websites 
or online sources (instead of local files like PDFs or text).
It fetches and reads content from a webpage URL, then converts it into a format (like a Document object) that LangChain can use.
