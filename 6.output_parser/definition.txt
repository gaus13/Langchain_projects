What are output parsers in langchain and what are its uses??

Output parsers in LangChain are components used to convert raw LLM output (usually plain text) into a structured format like:

(Python objects (e.g., dict, list)
Pydantic models
TypedDicts
JSON
Custom classes)

They help you reliably extract and interpret the modelâ€™s response so you can programmatically use it in your application.

#stringOutput parser (strOutputParser)
This is the simplest output parser in langchain. used to parse the output
of llm and return it a plain string

#structured output parser: helps extract structured json data from the llm
based on predefined schema
